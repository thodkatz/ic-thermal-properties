	abstract = {With the rapid development of high-speed digital circuits and high-integration-chip technology, more high-speed signals need to be transferred in high-speed interconnection. However, high-speed signals will experience delay, reflection, attenuation and crosstalk during the transferring. The transmission characteristic of printed circuit board (PCB) is very important as PCB is the support for the whole circuit systems. As the signal integrity is very critical for the electronic products, both designers of high-speed circuit and PCB manufactures focus on solving the signal integrity problem. Signal integrity in high-speed circuit design is very important. In this study, discontinuous ground and the via hole signal integrity analysis in the PCB level were carried out on the basis of transmission lines. Based on the results of the experiments, guidelines for design and manufacturing process were proposed to improve the signal integrity problem. With the rapid development of electronic technology, largescale and super large-scale integrated circuits are used in the systems. The size of the Integrate circuits chip is smaller and smaller, and the I/0 amount is more and more according to the package type of integrate circuits chip. And the speed of the signal is more and more fast with the development of the integrate circuits process. How to deal with the high-speed signal becomes the key while engineers design the circuits because of the smaller size of the electronic design, the higher density of the circuit layout, and the higher and higher frequency of the signal. With the rapid development of highspeed digital circuits and high-integration-chip technology, influence of the transmission line and delamination characteristic on system electronical performance is more and more important. Therefore, high speed system design need to solve signal integrity problems of delay .crosstalk and transmission line effect, and so on. The influence of the high-speed interconnection on signal integrity includes two parts.Firstly, delay, reflection, and crosstalk effect of transmission line because of the impedance mismatch, discontinuous interconnection. Secondly, isochronous Switching Noise (SSN), for some circuits sharing the ground or feeder with the EMC. The first part was carried out in this article. © 2010 IEEE.},

Keeping the PDN impedance very low in a wide frequency range, except at dc, by employing a shunt capacitors, which can be in-chip, package, or PCB levels, is the first priority way for PI design. The decoupling techniques including the planes structure, surface-mounted technology decoupling capacitors, and embedded capacitors will be discussed. The isolation approach that keeps part of the PDN at high impedance is another way to reduce the PDN noise propagation. Besides the typical isolation approaches such as the etched slots and filter, the new isolation concept using electromagnetic bandgap structures will also be discussed. © 2006 IEEE.},

	title = {A co-design methodology of signal integrity and power integrity},
	isbn = {978-1-60423-624-8},
	abstract = {As PCB interconnection density and channel data rate are getting increasingly higher, various 3D effects, crosstalk, and discontinuity-induced ISI are playing a much more important role, for both signal channels and power distribution networks. In particular, noise coupling between signal trace and power delivery network has become a key issue and performance limiter for high-speed chip-to-chip interface, which must be addressed appropriately. Understanding these combined signal integrity (SI) and power integrity (PI) issues in the era of gigahertz data rates requires advanced co-design methodology for SI and PI analysis. In this paper, a robust co-design methodology is established and successfully demonstrated through two case studies: investigations of DDR2-800 control bus resonance problem and DDR2-667 Vref bus noise issue. With traditional signal integrity simulations which consider an ideal power delivery system; these issues may not be observable until the post-silicon validation stage. With the co-design methodology, however, as root-causes of these issues are identified, more cost-effective resolutions become apparent at the pre-silicon design stage. Design guidelines, which were summarized from the two case studies regarding noise coupling by 3D effect and resonant structure, are demonstrated as follows: first, plane noise specification requires less than 150mV at the transition layer; second, to reduce plane-signal coupling, it's recommended that no reference layer change occur unless absolutely required; third, the stitch distance has to be much shorter than wavelength of the third harmonic of maximum digital frequency, and; fourth, resonance needs to be alleviated by keeping out critical lengths such as half and quarter wavelength at frequencies of interest.},

The present study focuses on the analysis of the noise that propagates from a power plane to another power plane due to their proximity. To mitigate this problem, proper design of both power and ground planes in the stack-up is illustrated.

	abstract = {A modeling methodology is proposed for the thermal analysis of the PCB structure based on integrating both the FVM-based numerical solution and the Fourier-series-based analytical solution of temperature. The heat spreading through tracks and the vertical heat transfer through vias are taken into account in a numerical way and regarded as the additional thermal boundary conditions of insulating layers, which are assumed to be homogeneous from an analytical point of view. A methodology based on the vertex-centered Cartesian-grid Finite Volume Method is also proposed for the electric analysis of PCB tracks in order to take into account the temperature-dependent Joule heating effect, thus the current carrying capacity of tracks can be estimated as well. The necessary and sufficient condition for solving electric distributions in multi-terminal tracks is discussed, described and verified through both the analysis of the equivalent resistor network in a multi-terminal track and the mathematical analysis of a matrix equation, which correlates terminal currents with terminal electric potentials. In addition, the method for analyzing the multilayer structure is also discussed. A thermal solver was developed in MATLAB based on the methodology. Several layouts were modeled in the solver and COMSOL to test the validity of the methodology and to investigate the influence factors of the solution. Based on the analysis and comparisons, mesh density and the number of eigenvalues are the main influence factors. The vertical and horizontal heat transfer contributions of vias were also investigated by modeling the footprint layout of a power mosfet in order to test the modeling assumptions. Finally, the consistency between the modeling results and the reference results was found. Both the advantages and disadvantages of the methodology are discussed throughout the analysis.},

The benefits of these 'virtual prototyping tools' are undisputed when it comes to performing parametric studies in early design phases. However, when the objective of the calculation is accuracy, as required for subsequent reliability and performance assessments, the discussion about the level of accuracy that we can expect in practice becomes far from trivial, as will be shown in this paper. A natural question is how accurate numerical simulations are when compared to well-designed experiments in prototypes or final products. Many studies demonstrate amazing agreement, the conclusion often being that 'validation of the numerical model' has been proven. It will be demonstrated that these conclusions are subject to serious doubts. This paper discusses 'every' topic associated with a comparison between numerical and experimental results that is based on first principles, not on fitting parameters until the two results match. The final conclusion is inevitable: the situation when all computations at the system level can be used for accurate temperature prediction is still a long way off.},

	abstract = {Abstract, Small satellites (less than 100 kg) are becoming increasingly utilized as an economical means of experimentation and research in orbit. The analysis of such systems presents unique challenges to the thermal engineer since the mass, power and volume available are all very limited, prohibiting use of some methods of thermal control. The experiments and subsystems must still be maintained within specified temperature limits, regardless of these problems and the extreme environments and changing power conditions (internally and externally) of the satellites. Analysis techniques, together with a comprehensive testing programme, ensure the thermal success of satellites throughout all phases of their intended missions. DERA has experience in the design of small satellites following the successful missions of the STRV 1a and 1b [1]. This technical paper details the unique thermal problems and their solution to achieve a functioning design of the subsequent satellites (STRV 1c and 1d).},
